# Prediction Markets, For and Against
Subtitle: A Multi-Part Series on the Epistemic Foundations and Institutional Limits of Market-Based Forecasting

[Prediction markets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction_market) are platforms for betting on future events, where the odds implied by market prices reflect a collective judgement about how likely those events are to occur. To the degree these prices are efficient in the sense that [prices in traditional financial markets are efficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis), they’d yield the best possible forecast for the probability of the event, aggregating dispersed information more reliably than expert consensus or polling, and thus serve as a powerful tool for decision-making.

Yet often when one suggests using them to help make important decisions — for example, to forecast the effects of new policies, or to improve corporate planning — one encounters a litany of bad, easily overcome objections. In fact, they’re so bad that Robin Hanson has come to believe that people simply don’t want good information as much as they say they do, a theme he pursues at length in his book [_The Elephant in the Brain: Hidden Motives in Everyday Life_](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Elephant-Brain-Hidden-Motives-Everyday/dp/0197551955/)[1](#footnote-1). Still, I think there is one objection that deserves to be taken seriously; I argue that it (rather than cognitive biases and hidden motives) explains why prediction markets have not been widely adopted.

This post proceeds as follows: I begin with a simple account of how prediction markets work, and then develop the argument for their efficiency indirectly, by showing why the most common objections fail. If you’re already familiar with these arguments, you can skip directly to the next section, where I turn to the one objection I believe genuinely has force — which relates to the distinction between merely aggregating private information, and incentivising knowledge discovery. Finally, I close by considering some implications of my argument for where prediction markets could be profitably introduced, and where they might not be so useful.

I should say at the outset that my understanding of prediction markets is in large part due to reading and listening to [Robin Hanson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Hanson)[2](#footnote-2). Although my description and arguments in favour of prediction markets may in places be very similar to his[3](#footnote-3), I do not make specific citations since I did not look at that material in writing this post; but for a superior presentation of these parts, I recommend his blog Overcoming Bias ([see](https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/prediction-markets-fail-to-moochhtml) [here](https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/seeking-robust-credible-expertise-buyershtml) [for](https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/prediction-markets-need-experimentationhtml) [some](https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/new-hire-prediction-marketshtml) [relevant](https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/shoulda-listened-futureshtml) [posts](https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/brand-truth-narrowlyhtml))[4](#footnote-4). Any mistakes, on the contrary, are of course my own.

[1](#footnote-anchor-1) On his podcast _Minds Almost Meeting_ with Agnes Callard, he addressed a question about why prediction markets remain relatively underused, [responding as follows](https://mindsalmostmeeting.com/episodes/polls-vs-prediction-markets):

> […] this was a key piece of information to me in my life, to see that we had this plausible, easily understood, widely accepted rationale for why people should be interested in prediction markets, and then to see that they didn't seem to be very interested. This was a key data point about the differences between what we say we want and what we actually want, which I explored in many other contexts in this book. This book doesn't actually talk about prediction markets, but I'd say, yes, a key fact about the social world is that we often talk as if we had certain motives and certain priorities. And then our actions, if you look carefully, seem to belie that, that is, they don't choose the things we would choose if we had the priorities we say we have.

[2](#footnote-anchor-2) Hanson was instrumental in innovating and popularising prediction markets. I link here to his Wikipedia, though I think his page there is (at the time of writing) rather unfair to him.
